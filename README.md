# Complain-Management-System
Created a complain management for a university system usinng c++
There are two types of departments in a university. Teaching departments and Staff Departments. Teachers who teach in teaching departments can file a complain to staff departments such as it account and admin. Each staff department has one manager who assign complains to staff working in that department. Staff do the work on the complain and updates the system. System notifies the manager and manager review the work done and change the status of complain to resolved. System than notfies the teacher that his complain has been solved. Teacher can give feedback on that complain. If teacher is satisified the status of complain is changed to closed if teacher is not satisfied. Manager and staff sees the complain as open issue and they need to work on it again.
There is director and adminstrator in the system.
Director can see the summary of any complain filed in any of the staff department by the teachers of teaching departments and see the information regarding the complain
Administrator can add remove staff members and teacher. He can also replace the manager of department

Teacher and staff need to enter their unique id to login in to the system
Director and Administrator need to enter their id and passoword to login to the system

When the code is run all the classes and objects are populated by the data present in files. When the system is shut down all the data is uploaded to the files
Data persistence ensured by text files

Followed the famous SOLID Principles of Software Design and Analysis
